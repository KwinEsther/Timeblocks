# TimeBlocks  
A decentralized Pomodoro timer built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. TimeBlocks helps users boost productivity by tracking focus sessions, rewarding them with tokens, and providing an immutable record of their progress.  

## Features  
- **Blockchain-based Tracking:** Immutable logs of completed Pomodoro sessions stored on the blockchain.  
- **Token Rewards:** Users earn tokens for completing focus sessions and maintaining streaks.  
- **Immutable Productivity Records:** Transparent, tamper-proof logs for productivity tracking.  
- **Accountability and Motivation:** Incentives for maintaining consistent productivity.

## How It Works  
1. **Start a Session:**  
   Users initiate a Pomodoro timer (e.g., 25 minutes of focus).  

2. **Complete the Session:**  
   Upon successful completion, the session is recorded on the blockchain, and users are rewarded with tokens.  

3. **Track Progress:**  
   Users can view their focus streaks and overall productivity records using read-only functions.  

4. **Earn Rewards:**  
   Consistent focus sessions and streaks earn additional rewards, encouraging productivity.
